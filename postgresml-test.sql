Sunil provided a great overview of their roadmap going forward with their key customers such as Clorox, Dollar General, Aldi, Amazon, and Kroger to name a few. MonoSol provided a overview of updated marketing data as well as our offerings in the short medium and long term film offerings. The meeting was successful with some great takeaways to move us all forward in this partnership. The meeting started with a thank you from both sides for the execution of the supply agreement. Sunil provided a roadmap of his plans to work with branded players such as Clorox and Lysol going forward. He is not currently working towards the big box stores such as Walmart and Costco. Sunil is very interested in working with C&D on their co-packing needs. Upcoming launches to watch for: 1.        Clorox Laundry as a value brand (new) 2.        Clorox Oxi Clean 3.        Lysol cleaners 4.        Liquid Plumber 5.        Amazon laundry 6.        Amazon cleaners re-launch Sunil presented that New Wave is planning for 4 sites. All sites will have 3-4 converters that are capable of 700 million – 1 billion packs a year. There will be 3 sites for manufacturing and 1 for packaging and storage. The sites for manufacturing will be in Atlanta, Cincinnati, and St. Louis. The packaging and storage location will be in Cincinnati. MonoSol reviewed the current analysis of the 2Q marketing data as well as our current plans for short-, medium- and long-term film plans, highlighting the bio-based film options. Sunil was very excited about these plans and asked to be used as our new film testing ground going forward. He also indicated he would like us to start work immediately with his team on film optimization for price and performance. Sunil also indicated he would be happy to include us with his meetings with top customers for current and future opportunities. These meetings will start to be scheduled soon. Net, the meeting was very productive and several opportunities were identified for both MonoSol and NW to take on together such as with Clorox and Private Label customers.'

			New VECs Line 80 at Alex (ex-line 11 Urlati) - starting up Lima new line next Peel roll qualification Agreed results were weird - cannot conclusively say LRT failure was due to peel roll, 
			VEC or MonoSol line A new trial needs to be designed and with better controls L29 Lima trials Preferred is to do a silent trial - inform only MPD but not the operator/supervisor level. 
			Afraid psychological conditioning of the team affects trial success MonoSol can continue with plan to ship 3 pallets ahead of the full load 
			No special placards Trial ETA - mid-March Lima new MPD director (Andrea) bringing improved controls over Lima recent noncompliance with storage and film handling guidelines 
			Ñew BRC - designing trials in US and Asia - Q3 and Q4 - support from MonoSol CTT Narrow web - trials being designed for Alex mid-summer - new BRC takes priority - MS to be on-site as well 
			Patrice from Jon&#39;s team in EU taking over 4in1 trial design in Amiens. will take similar approach as in US with reviewing Amiens process including film storage, etc. 
			MonoSol load scheduled to ship on week 2/29 to support trials
			'    
			,'In our regular connect, we discussed the following: Sven: How’s Quality? 3.5ppm of all VEC, 25 lines, not one line spiking, worst VEC is 6ppm, 
			best (Takasaki) 1ppm – target is still 1ppm - great result! After implementation of Vision system for 100% pod inspection (leakers), targets will be reset. 
			4ppm today translates into 16ppm with 100% inspection thru the system. Last week: on a VEC, 3000ppm leakers on one line in one minute. Vision system saw them all!! 
			Reason: blocked nozzle in liquid dosing. Consumer complaints: no reduction seen . 2x versus traditional products, JP 3x complaints (as JP complaints easily). 
			Actual: 200 complaints / 1MM cases sold. Target: 100 in the next three years, 50-80 as with HDL overall target. 
			Tim, Benoit pushed R&amp;D to reduce the consumer complaints 30% leakers (10% due to Pinholes) 30% dissolution - EU minus 5`C colder wash, 
			higher complaints – need to change formulation 30% sticky pods 10% others Next : Harmonize activities between MS and P&G 
			to reduce consumer complaints 2024 is year of excellence for MS, 8 wks firm zone, stabilizing production. Tim: Q423 results will be good. 
			What’s next: funding of the new site NA SUD pushed out. Relook at it in Dec’24. Design work not finished. After this it takes 30 months to build site. 
			Business did not deliver enough cash in 2023 to fund new VEC&#39;s in NA. L90 in Alex expanding, then new plant required to install new VEC''s Europe business catches up.
			'
			,'The purpose of the meeting was to align with Sunil from New Wave on jointly moving forward to their customer base on a partnership for current and future opportunities. 
			Sunil provided a great overview of their roadmap going forward with their key customers such as Clorox, Dollar General, Aldi, Amazon, and Kroger to name a few. 
			MonoSol provided a overview of updated marketing data as well as our offerings in the short medium and long term film offerings. 
			The meeting was successful with some great takeaways to move us all forward in this partnership. 
			The meeting started with a thank you from both sides for the execution of the supply agreement. 
			Sunil provided a roadmap of his plans to work with branded players such as Clorox and Lysol going forward. 
			He is not currently working towards the big box stores such as Walmart and Costco. 
			Sunil is very interested in working with C&D on their co-packing needs. 
			Upcoming launches to watch for: 1.        Clorox Laundry as a value brand (new) 2.        Clorox Oxi Clean 3.        Lysol cleaners 
			4.        Liquid Plumber 5.        Amazon laundry 6.        Amazon cleaners re-launch Sunil presented that New Wave is planning for 4 sites. 
			All sites will have 3-4 converters that are capable of 700 million – 1 billion packs a year. There will be 3 sites for manufacturing and 1 for packaging and storage. 
			The sites for manufacturing will be in Atlanta, Cincinnati, and St. Louis. The packaging and storage location will be in Cincinnati. 
			MonoSol reviewed the current analysis of the 2Q marketing data as well as our current plans for short-, medium- and long-term film plans, highlighting the bio-based film options. 
			Sunil was very excited about these plans and asked to be used as our new film testing ground going forward. 
			He also indicated he would like us to start work immediately with his team on film optimization for price and performance. 
			Sunil also indicated he would be happy to include us with his meetings with top customers for current and future opportunities. These meetings will start to be scheduled soon.
			Net, the meeting was very productive and several opportunities were identified for both MonoSol and NW to take on together such as with Clorox and Private Label customers.

			'New Az site push back - Per Jon reason was commercial and related with high sales fluctuation. 
			Volumes are stable and good right now, but fluctuation is concerning sales to justify investment. 
			New VECs Line 80 at Alex (ex-line 11 Urlati) - starting up Lima new line next Peel roll qualification Agreed results were weird - cannot conclusively say LRT failure was due to peel roll, 
			VEC or MonoSol line A new trial needs to be designed and with better controls L29 Lima trials Preferred is to do a silent trial - inform only MPD but not the operator/supervisor level. 
			Afraid psychological conditioning of the team affects trial success MonoSol can continue with plan to ship 3 pallets ahead of the full load 
			No special placards Trial ETA - mid-March Lima new MPD director (Andrea) bringing improved controls over Lima recent noncompliance with storage and film handling guidelines 
			Ñew BRC - designing trials in US and Asia - Q3 and Q4 - support from MonoSol CTT Narrow web - trials being designed for Alex mid-summer - new BRC takes priority - MS to be on-site as well 
			Patrice from Jon&#39;s team in EU taking over 4in1 trial design in Amiens. will take similar approach as in US with reviewing Amiens process including film storage, etc. 
			MonoSol load scheduled to ship on week 2/29 to support trials
			'    
			,'In our regular connect, we discussed the following: Sven: How’s Quality? 3.5ppm of all VEC, 25 lines, not one line spiking, worst VEC is 6ppm, 
			best (Takasaki) 1ppm – target is still 1ppm - great result! After implementation of Vision system for 100% pod inspection (leakers), targets will be reset. 
			4ppm today translates into 16ppm with 100% inspection thru the system. Last week: on a VEC, 3000ppm leakers on one line in one minute. Vision system saw them all!! 
			Reason: blocked nozzle in liquid dosing. Consumer complaints: no reduction seen . 2x versus traditional products, JP 3x complaints (as JP complaints easily). 
			Actual: 200 complaints / 1MM cases sold. Target: 100 in the next three years, 50-80 as with HDL overall target. 
			Tim, Benoit pushed R&amp;D to reduce the consumer complaints 30% leakers (10% due to Pinholes) 30% dissolution - EU minus 5`C colder wash, 
			higher complaints – need to change formulation 30% sticky pods 10% others Next : Harmonize activities between MS and P&G 
			to reduce consumer complaints 2024 is year of excellence for MS, 8 wks firm zone, stabilizing production. Tim: Q423 results will be good. 
			What’s next: funding of the new site NA SUD pushed out. Relook at it in Dec’24. Design work not finished. After this it takes 30 months to build site. 
			Business did not deliver enough cash in 2023 to fund new VEC&#39;s in NA. L90 in Alex expanding, then new plant required to install new VEC''s Europe business catches up.
			'
			,'The purpose of the meeting was to align with Sunil from New Wave on jointly moving forward to their customer base on a partnership for current and future opportunities. 
			Sunil provided a great overview of their roadmap going forward with their key customers such as Clorox, Dollar General, Aldi, Amazon, and Kroger to name a few. 
			MonoSol provided a overview of updated marketing data as well as our offerings in the short medium and long term film offerings. 
			The meeting was successful with some great takeaways to move us all forward in this partnership. 
			The meeting started with a thank you from both sides for the execution of the supply agreement. 
			Sunil provided a roadmap of his plans to work with branded players such as Clorox and Lysol going forward. 
			He is not currently working towards the big box stores such as Walmart and Costco. 
			Sunil is very interested in working with C&D on their co-packing needs. 
			Upcoming launches to watch for: 1.        Clorox Laundry as a value brand (new) 2.        Clorox Oxi Clean 3.        Lysol cleaners 
			4.        Liquid Plumber 5.        Amazon laundry 6.        Amazon cleaners re-launch Sunil presented that New Wave is planning for 4 sites. 
			All sites will have 3-4 converters that are capable of 700 million – 1 billion packs a year. There will be 3 sites for manufacturing and 1 for packaging and storage. 
			The sites for manufacturing will be in Atlanta, Cincinnati, and St. Louis. The packaging and storage location will be in Cincinnati. 
			MonoSol reviewed the current analysis of the 2Q marketing data as well as our current plans for short-, medium- and long-term film plans, highlighting the bio-based film options. 
			Sunil was very excited about these plans and asked to be used as our new film testing ground going forward. 
			He also indicated he would like us to start work immediately with his team on film optimization for price and performance. 
			Sunil also indicated he would be happy to include us with his meetings with top customers for current and future opportunities. These meetings will start to be scheduled soon.
			Net, the meeting was very productive and several opportunities were identified for both MonoSol and NW to take on together such as with Clorox and Private Label customers.

			'New Az site push back - Per Jon reason was commercial and related with high sales fluctuation. 
			Volumes are stable and good right now, but fluctuation is concerning sales to justify investment. 
			New VECs Line 80 at Alex (ex-line 11 Urlati) - starting up Lima new line next Peel roll qualification Agreed results were weird - cannot conclusively say LRT failure was due to peel roll, 
			VEC or MonoSol line A new trial needs to be designed and with better controls L29 Lima trials Preferred is to do a silent trial - inform only MPD but not the operator/supervisor level. 
			Afraid psychological conditioning of the team affects trial success MonoSol can continue with plan to ship 3 pallets ahead of the full load 
			No special placards Trial ETA - mid-March Lima new MPD director (Andrea) bringing improved controls over Lima recent noncompliance with storage and film handling guidelines 
			Ñew BRC - designing trials in US and Asia - Q3 and Q4 - support from MonoSol CTT Narrow web - trials being designed for Alex mid-summer - new BRC takes priority - MS to be on-site as well 
			Patrice from Jon&#39;s team in EU taking over 4in1 trial design in Amiens. will take similar approach as in US with reviewing Amiens process including film storage, etc. 
			MonoSol load scheduled to ship on week 2/29 to support trials
			'    
			,'In our regular connect, we discussed the following: Sven: How’s Quality? 3.5ppm of all VEC, 25 lines, not one line spiking, worst VEC is 6ppm, 
			best (Takasaki) 1ppm – target is still 1ppm - great result! After implementation of Vision system for 100% pod inspection (leakers), targets will be reset. 
			4ppm today translates into 16ppm with 100% inspection thru the system. Last week: on a VEC, 3000ppm leakers on one line in one minute. Vision system saw them all!! 
			Reason: blocked nozzle in liquid dosing. Consumer complaints: no reduction seen . 2x versus traditional products, JP 3x complaints (as JP complaints easily). 
			Actual: 200 complaints / 1MM cases sold. Target: 100 in the next three years, 50-80 as with HDL overall target. 
			Tim, Benoit pushed R&amp;D to reduce the consumer complaints 30% leakers (10% due to Pinholes) 30% dissolution - EU minus 5`C colder wash, 
			higher complaints – need to change formulation 30% sticky pods 10% others Next : Harmonize activities between MS and P&G 
			to reduce consumer complaints 2024 is year of excellence for MS, 8 wks firm zone, stabilizing production. Tim: Q423 results will be good. 
			What’s next: funding of the new site NA SUD pushed out. Relook at it in Dec’24. Design work not finished. After this it takes 30 months to build site. 
			Business did not deliver enough cash in 2023 to fund new VEC&#39;s in NA. L90 in Alex expanding, then new plant required to install new VEC''s Europe business catches up.
			'
			,'The purpose of the meeting was to align with Sunil from New Wave on jointly moving forward to their customer base on a partnership for current and future opportunities. 
			Sunil provided a great overview of their roadmap going forward with their key customers such as Clorox, Dollar General, Aldi, Amazon, and Kroger to name a few. 
			MonoSol provided a overview of updated marketing data as well as our offerings in the short medium and long term film offerings. 
			The meeting was successful with some great takeaways to move us all forward in this partnership. 
			The meeting started with a thank you from both sides for the execution of the supply agreement. 
			Sunil provided a roadmap of his plans to work with branded players such as Clorox and Lysol going forward. 
			He is not currently working towards the big box stores such as Walmart and Costco. 
			Sunil is very interested in working with C&D on their co-packing needs. 
			Upcoming launches to watch for: 1.        Clorox Laundry as a value brand (new) 2.        Clorox Oxi Clean 3.        Lysol cleaners 
			4.        Liquid Plumber 5.        Amazon laundry 6.        Amazon cleaners re-launch Sunil presented that New Wave is planning for 4 sites. 
			All sites will have 3-4 converters that are capable of 700 million – 1 billion packs a year. There will be 3 sites for manufacturing and 1 for packaging and storage. 
			The sites for manufacturing will be in Atlanta, Cincinnati, and St. Louis. The packaging and storage location will be in Cincinnati. 
			MonoSol reviewed the current analysis of the 2Q marketing data as well as our current plans for short-, medium- and long-term film plans, highlighting the bio-based film options. 
			Sunil was very excited about these plans and asked to be used as our new film testing ground going forward. 
			He also indicated he would like us to start work immediately with his team on film optimization for price and performance. 
			Sunil also indicated he would be happy to include us with his meetings with top customers for current and future opportunities. These meetings will start to be scheduled soon.
			Net, the meeting was very productive and several opportunities were identified for both MonoSol and NW to take on together such as with Clorox and Private Label customers.

			'New Az site push back - Per Jon reason was commercial and related with high sales fluctuation. 
			Volumes are stable and good right now, but fluctuation is concerning sales to justify investment. 
			New VECs Line 80 at Alex (ex-line 11 Urlati) - starting up Lima new line next Peel roll qualification Agreed results were weird - cannot conclusively say LRT failure was due to peel roll, 
			VEC or MonoSol line A new trial needs to be designed and with better controls L29 Lima trials Preferred is to do a silent trial - inform only MPD but not the operator/supervisor level. 
			Afraid psychological conditioning of the team affects trial success MonoSol can continue with plan to ship 3 pallets ahead of the full load 
			No special placards Trial ETA - mid-March Lima new MPD director (Andrea) bringing improved controls over Lima recent noncompliance with storage and film handling guidelines 
			Ñew BRC - designing trials in US and Asia - Q3 and Q4 - support from MonoSol CTT Narrow web - trials being designed for Alex mid-summer - new BRC takes priority - MS to be on-site as well 
			Patrice from Jon&#39;s team in EU taking over 4in1 trial design in Amiens. will take similar approach as in US with reviewing Amiens process including film storage, etc. 
			MonoSol load scheduled to ship on week 2/29 to support trials
			'    
			,'In our regular connect, we discussed the following: Sven: How’s Quality? 3.5ppm of all VEC, 25 lines, not one line spiking, worst VEC is 6ppm, 
			best (Takasaki) 1ppm – target is still 1ppm - great result! After implementation of Vision system for 100% pod inspection (leakers), targets will be reset. 
			4ppm today translates into 16ppm with 100% inspection thru the system. Last week: on a VEC, 3000ppm leakers on one line in one minute. Vision system saw them all!! 
			Reason: blocked nozzle in liquid dosing. Consumer complaints: no reduction seen . 2x versus traditional products, JP 3x complaints (as JP complaints easily). 
			Actual: 200 complaints / 1MM cases sold. Target: 100 in the next three years, 50-80 as with HDL overall target. 
			Tim, Benoit pushed R&amp;D to reduce the consumer complaints 30% leakers (10% due to Pinholes) 30% dissolution - EU minus 5`C colder wash, 
			higher complaints – need to change formulation 30% sticky pods 10% others Next : Harmonize activities between MS and P&G 
			to reduce consumer complaints 2024 is year of excellence for MS, 8 wks firm zone, stabilizing production. Tim: Q423 results will be good. 
			What’s next: funding of the new site NA SUD pushed out. Relook at it in Dec’24. Design work not finished. After this it takes 30 months to build site. 
			Business did not deliver enough cash in 2023 to fund new VEC&#39;s in NA. L90 in Alex expanding, then new plant required to install new VEC''s Europe business catches up.
			'
			,'The purpose of the meeting was to align with Sunil from New Wave on jointly moving forward to their customer base on a partnership for current and future opportunities. 
			Sunil provided a great overview of their roadmap going forward with their key customers such as Clorox, Dollar General, Aldi, Amazon, and Kroger to name a few. 
			MonoSol provided a overview of updated marketing data as well as our offerings in the short medium and long term film offerings. 
			The meeting was successful with some great takeaways to move us all forward in this partnership. 
			The meeting started with a thank you from both sides for the execution of the supply agreement. 
			Sunil provided a roadmap of his plans to work with branded players such as Clorox and Lysol going forward. 
			He is not currently working towards the big box stores such as Walmart and Costco. 
			Sunil is very interested in working with C&D on their co-packing needs. 
			Upcoming launches to watch for: 1.        Clorox Laundry as a value brand (new) 2.        Clorox Oxi Clean 3.        Lysol cleaners 
			4.        Liquid Plumber 5.        Amazon laundry 6.        Amazon cleaners re-launch Sunil presented that New Wave is planning for 4 sites. 
			All sites will have 3-4 converters that are capable of 700 million – 1 billion packs a year. There will be 3 sites for manufacturing and 1 for packaging and storage. 
			The sites for manufacturing will be in Atlanta, Cincinnati, and St. Louis. The packaging and storage location will be in Cincinnati. 
			MonoSol reviewed the current analysis of the 2Q marketing data as well as our current plans for short-, medium- and long-term film plans, highlighting the bio-based film options. 
			Sunil was very excited about these plans and asked to be used as our new film testing ground going forward. 
			He also indicated he would like us to start work immediately with his team on film optimization for price and performance. 
			Sunil also indicated he would be happy to include us with his meetings with top customers for current and future opportunities. These meetings will start to be scheduled soon.
			Net, the meeting was very productive and several opportunities were identified for both MonoSol and NW to take on together such as with Clorox and Private Label customers.

'New Az site push back - Per Jon reason was commercial and related with high sales fluctuation. 
Volumes are stable and good right now, but fluctuation is concerning sales to justify investment. 
New VECs Line 80 at Alex (ex-line 11 Urlati) - starting up Lima new line next Peel roll qualification Agreed results were weird - cannot conclusively say LRT failure was due to peel roll, 
VEC or MonoSol line A new trial needs to be designed and with better controls L29 Lima trials Preferred is to do a silent trial - inform only MPD but not the operator/supervisor level. 
Afraid psychological conditioning of the team affects trial success MonoSol can continue with plan to ship 3 pallets ahead of the full load 
No special placards Trial ETA - mid-March Lima new MPD director (Andrea) bringing improved controls over Lima recent noncompliance with storage and film handling guidelines 
Ñew BRC - designing trials in US and Asia - Q3 and Q4 - support from MonoSol CTT Narrow web - trials being designed for Alex mid-summer - new BRC takes priority - MS to be on-site as well 
Patrice from Jon&#39;s team in EU taking over 4in1 trial design in Amiens. will take similar approach as in US with reviewing Amiens process including film storage, etc. 
MonoSol load scheduled to ship on week 2/29 to support trials'

'In our regular connect, we discussed the following: Sven: How’s Quality? 3.5ppm of all VEC, 25 lines, not one line spiking, worst VEC is 6ppm, 
best (Takasaki) 1ppm – target is still 1ppm - great result! After implementation of Vision system for 100% pod inspection (leakers), targets will be reset. 
4ppm today translates into 16ppm with 100% inspection thru the system. Last week: on a VEC, 3000ppm leakers on one line in one minute. Vision system saw them all!! 
Reason: blocked nozzle in liquid dosing. Consumer complaints: no reduction seen . 2x versus traditional products, JP 3x complaints (as JP complaints easily). 
Actual: 200 complaints / 1MM cases sold. Target: 100 in the next three years, 50-80 as with HDL overall target. 
Tim, Benoit pushed R&amp;D to reduce the consumer complaints 30% leakers (10% due to Pinholes) 30% dissolution - EU minus 5`C colder wash, 
higher complaints – need to change formulation 30% sticky pods 10% others Next : Harmonize activities between MS and P&G 
to reduce consumer complaints 2024 is year of excellence for MS, 8 wks firm zone, stabilizing production. Tim: Q423 results will be good. 
What’s next: funding of the new site NA SUD pushed out. Relook at it in Dec’24. Design work not finished. After this it takes 30 months to build site. 
Business did not deliver enough cash in 2023 to fund new VEC&#39;s in NA. L90 in Alex expanding, then new plant required to install new VEC''s Europe business catches up.

'The purpose of the meeting was to align with Sunil from New Wave on jointly moving forward to their customer base on a partnership for current and future opportunities. 
Sunil provided a great overview of their roadmap going forward with their key customers such as Clorox, Dollar General, Aldi, Amazon, and Kroger to name a few. 
MonoSol provided a overview of updated marketing data as well as our offerings in the short medium and long term film offerings. 
The meeting was successful with some great takeaways to move us all forward in this partnership. 
The meeting started with a thank you from both sides for the execution of the supply agreement. 
Sunil provided a roadmap of his plans to work with branded players such as Clorox and Lysol going forward. 
He is not currently working towards the big box stores such as Walmart and Costco. 
Sunil is very interested in working with C&D on their co-packing needs. 
Upcoming launches to watch for: 1.        Clorox Laundry as a value brand (new) 2.        Clorox Oxi Clean 3.        Lysol cleaners 
4.        Liquid Plumber 5.        Amazon laundry 6.        Amazon cleaners re-launch Sunil presented that New Wave is planning for 4 sites. 
All sites will have 3-4 converters that are capable of 700 million – 1 billion packs a year. There will be 3 sites for manufacturing and 1 for packaging and storage. 
The sites for manufacturing will be in Atlanta, Cincinnati, and St. Louis. The packaging and storage location will be in Cincinnati. 
MonoSol reviewed the current analysis of the 2Q marketing data as well as our current plans for short-, medium- and long-term film plans, highlighting the bio-based film options. 
Sunil was very excited about these plans and asked to be used as our new film testing ground going forward. 
He also indicated he would like us to start work immediately with his team on film optimization for price and performance. 
Sunil also indicated he would be happy to include us with his meetings with top customers for current and future opportunities. These meetings will start to be scheduled soon.
Net, the meeting was very productive and several opportunities were identified for both MonoSol and NW to take on together such as with Clorox and Private Label customers.
